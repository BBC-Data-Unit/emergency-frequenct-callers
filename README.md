In March we [reported](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-43293581) that ambulances and emergency response vehicles were deployed more than 1,500 times to five patients in 12 months, and 8,303 emergency calls were made by the five most frequent UK callers.

The figures were released after a Freedom of Information request to the UK's 14 ambulance trusts by **Matt Graveling**. You can [read the questions from the FOI request here](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/emergency-frequent-callers/blob/master/foirequest.md)

## Definitions

A frequent caller is defined as an adult (18+) years who makes 5 or more emergency calls related to individual episodes of care in a month, or 12 or more emergency calls related to individual episodes of care in 3 months, from a private dwelling. (Please note, each trust's definition may vary slightly).  The average 'job time' for an ambulance being given a job, visiting a patient, and becoming available for the next call is 1 hour and 13 minutes. The Excel spreadsheet lists how many times a crew was deployed to a prolific frequent caller.
